# üîß VERCEL FUNCTION LIMIT FIX - RESOLVED

## ‚ùå Problem
You hit **Vercel's Hobby plan limit of 12 serverless functions** but had 18+ functions, causing deployment failure:
```
Error: No more than 12 Serverless Functions can be added to a Deployment on the Hobby plan.
```

## ‚úÖ Solution
**Consolidated all 18+ functions into a single `api/index.js` function** that handles all routes internally.

### What Was Changed:

1. **Single Function Architecture**
   - All routes now handled by `/api/index.js` 
   - Reduced from 18+ functions to 1 function
   - Well under Vercel's 12-function limit

2. **Removed Individual Functions**
   - Deleted all separate API files:
     - `api/_utils.js`
     - `api/_routerAdapter.js`
     - `api/health.js`
     - `api/getNTB_ETB.js`
     - `api/cif.js`
     - `api/applications.js`
     - `api/autoloan.js`
     - `api/cashplus.js`
     - `api/creditcard.js`
     - `api/personal-details.js`
     - `api/current-address.js`
     - `api/permanent-address.js`
     - `api/employment-details.js`
     - `api/reference-contacts.js`
     - `api/vehicle-details.js`
     - `api/insurance-details.js`
     - `api/contact-details.js`
     - `api/verification.js`

3. **Updated Vercel Configuration**
   - Modified `vercel.json` to use single function
   - All routes now redirect to `/api/index.js`

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy
**All changes pushed to GitHub** - You can now redeploy on Vercel!

### Function Count Summary:
- **Before**: 18+ functions ‚ùå (exceeds limit)
- **After**: 1 function ‚úÖ (under limit)

## üìã Deployment Steps:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Redeploy the backend project
3. Should deploy successfully without function limit errors

All functionality remains the same - just consolidated into one efficient function!
